INFO
----------
The React webapp 'final-project' runs on port 3000. to start, open the final-project
directory in a Command Line Interface (current directory would be ".../final-project/")
and run the webapp with the command "npm start".

The REST API 'usersapi' runs on port 3400.. To start the API, open the usersapi
directory in a CLI (directory would be ".../usersapi/") and run the API using the
command "npm start". The API should be up and running after the "Server and database
initialized" message is displayed.

WARNINGS
----------
The React webapp can take quite some time to initialize, so only assume the webapp
has crashed when an error message is displayed.
MongoDB requires IP authorization from the database-end, so anybody who attempts to
use the API from a computer that isn't on the allowed IP list will fail to run the API,
and the API will fail to run.
